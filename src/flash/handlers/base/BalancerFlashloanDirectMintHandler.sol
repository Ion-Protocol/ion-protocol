/**
 * @notice This contract allows for easy creation of leverage positions through
 * Balancer flashloans and LST mints through the LST provider.
 *
 * @dev There are a couple things to consider here from a security perspective. The
 * first one is that the flashloan callback must only be callable from the
 * Balancer vault. This ensures that nobody can pass arbitrary data to the
 * callback. The second one is that the flashloan must only be initialized from
 * this contract. This is a trickier one to enforce since Balancer flashloans
 * are not EIP-3156 compliant and do not pass on the initiator through the
 * callback. To get around this, an inverse reentrancy lock of sorts is used.
 * The lock is set to 2 when a flashloan is initiated and set to 1 once the
 * callback execution terminates. If the lock is not 2 when the callback is
 * called, then the flashloan was not initiated by this contract and the tx is
 * reverted.
 *
 * This contract currently deposits directly into LST contract 1:1. It should be
 * noted that a more favorable trade could be possible via DEXs.
