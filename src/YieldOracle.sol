/**
 * @notice An on-chain oracle that provides the APY for each collateral type.
 *
 * @dev This contract stores a history of the exchange rates of each collateral
 * for the past `LOOK_BACK` days. Every time that `updateAll()` is called, it
 * will update the value at `currentIndex` in the `historicalExchangeRates` with the
 * current exchange rate and it will also calculate the APY for each collateral
 * type based on the data currently in the buffer. The APY is calculated by
 * taking the difference between the new element being added and the element
 * being replaced. This provides a growth amount of `LOOK_BACK` days. This value
 * is then projected out to a year.
 *
 * Similar to the `InterestRate` module, as the amount of collaterals added to
 * the market increases, storage reads during interest accrual can become
 * prohibitively expensive. Therefore, this contract is heavily optimized at the
 * unfortunate cost of code-complexity.
