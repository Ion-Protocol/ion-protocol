/**
 * @dev There a couple things to consider here from a security perspective. The
 * first one is that the flashloan callback must only be callable from the
 * Balancer vault. This ensures that nobody can pass arbitrary data to the
 * callback from initiating a separate flashloan. The second one is that the
 * flashloan must only be initialized from this contract. This is a trickier one
 * to enforce since Balancer flashloans are not EIP-3156 compliant and do not
 * pass on the initiator through the callback. To get around this, an inverse
 * reentrancy lock of sorts is used. The lock is set to 2 when a flashloan is initiated
 * and set to 1 once the callback execution terminates. If the lock is not 2
 * when the callback is called, then the flashloan was not initiated by this
 * contract and the tx is reverted.
 *
 * This contract currently deposits directly into LST contract 1:1. It should be
 * noted that a more favorable trade could be possible via DEXs.
